<h2 align="center">Zar Mendoza's Intriguing Introduction</h2>

### This section will be composed of interesting facts:

* I have a background in the service industry. I have been cooking as a chef and sous chef for over ten years; I returned to university in the fall of 2019. 
* I am engaged and planning a wedding for May of 2022. 
* A member of my fantasy basketball league posted software engineering and other similar job listings from ESPN and that's what fueled my initial re-entry into higher education. 

#### Technical Background
I have experience with Java, Python, and some RDBMs. As far as program requirements, I am also enrolled in Systems Level Programming and Discrete Structures 2 this semester; So, I am looking forward to learning git and C and plan to start experimenting more with hardware in my free time.
